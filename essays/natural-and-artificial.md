### I. Introduction

The role of AI in education, broadly, provides a pivotal point of how I interact and engage with learning materials. AI provides an interface to allow myself to a self-directed learner, allowing myself to infer through socratic dialogues through these large language models. From my personal experiences, I utilize AI for exploratory research, inferring diverse takes, opinions, and methodologies in all kinds of subject, from summarizing a class syllabus, to generating a strategy plan for an exam in the upcoming days, AI, in my sense, felt like a divine intervention for scholars who want to go far beyond the classroom. I have used tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT Github's Co-pilot for my ICS 314 adventures. Throughout my interactions, I utilized all of top large language models for my own educational purposes - such as lecture summarization, code generation, code debugging, code reviews, and system design. I used these tools as a way to further enhance my learning experiences, and explore various thought experiments such as 'what ifs'

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18

  Indeed, I have used AI in the context of Experience WODs, albeit helping with the mundance tasks of some assignments. For instance, within E12-14, given the task to scribe the menu of items given in the image for further computational analysis, I have used ChatGPT's GPT-4, specifically, their Vision API, to do this mundance tasks of scribing the menu items for me, as I focus most of my cognitive efforts on the algorithm aspects. Surprisingly, I did this to merely test the capabilities of GPT-4's Vision, and as expected, it was able to correctly identify and categorize the list of items correclty as displayed on the Menu image. Whenever I had a task that I felt redundant, I would infer to ChatGPT to do most of the grunt work for me.

  2. In-class Practice WODs

  Indeed, I have used AI for In-class Practice WODs for critique purposes. Often times, I am quite curious of how solutions are implemented, and realized that all solutions from whatever problem differ from eachother, based on the experience of the developer. For example, during the phase of learning programming problems, such as isUnique, I used ChatGPT to discuss the various diverse srategies to solve this solution, and pros/cons for each. Then, I would ask it to critique my own solution, and ways I could improve, either by adding an early-stopping rule or making it more readable. I still utilize the insights I've gained from these events, and embed them into my current programming skillsets.

  3. In-class WODs

  Indeed, I have used AI for In-class Practice WODS, albeit for the purpose of saftey. Since AI can be freely distributed across any In-Class WODS, and the fact that In-Class WODS are usually high-stakes assignments, I have used ChatGPT intensively to ensure the correctness of my work. In fact, as the In-Class WODS got more and more complex, (i.e, stacking up with Frameworks and Libaries), I notice ChatGPT can alleviate the stress of trying to memorize and frantically searching the documents for a piece of code, and saves more time, a variable that is crucial for such assignment.

  4. Essays

  Indeed, I have used AI for Essays for exploratory research. Throughout the variosu essays I've wrote, I often sought ChatGPT to give me concrete examples of code I was attempting to demostrate, or say, given a reading article, I would often copy the entire article and ask ChatGPT to summarize briefly, outlining the key topics points and what our instructors were expecting us to extrapolate from these readings. For instance, in Reflect on Smart Questions Essay, I've used AI to summarize all Raymond's How To Ask Questions The Smart Way article, and what insights should I take away wiht to make me become a better engineer. Then, I also used it as a way to learn how to filter questions based on Raymond's principles. This gave me concrete examples and further enhance my knowledge of how to curate smart questions.

  5. Final project

  Indeed, I have used AI for the Final Project. Most of my usage was for generating templates to start off my tasks in hand. For instance, one of my tasks what to design a Friend system for our web app, and had no previous experiences of how to design a Friend system. Hence, I learned a bit more of system design of how a friend system would operate, and its design in both front end and back end. Without this, It would've taken me a significant amount of time of by researching manually, and still end up with the same conclusions that ChatGPT has exhaustively listed in mere seconds. This is valuable as milestones for this course had a short time frame, and our team needed to work around this time constraint.

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial

  Indeed, I have used AI for learning concepts, primarily being my own personal AI tutor. For instance, I taught several of these large language models to make my own learning personalized, utilizing analogy as a way of deconstructing complex information, and making the unfamiliar, familiar, thereby transforming abstract concepts into relatable and understandable lessons. For instance, I would, funny as it is, make ChatGPT to be the role of my favorite fictional character, and teach me in the style of how my favoirte fictional characters would approach things. This makes my personal journey of learning a concept more interactive, enganging, and fun for concepts that are too complicated to digest.

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

  No, unfortuantel I did not had a chance to utilize AIs for answering questions in class or in Discord. I was very inactive in the community, hence zero usage for AI in this aspects. Most of my time was spent listening and learning from my peers and instructor.

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question

  No, unfortuantely I did not had a chance to ask or answer smart questions. I was very inactive in Discord, hence zero usage for AI in this aspects.

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

  Indeed, I have used AI to provide various and diverse coding examples for WODs, experiences, and for the final project. In fact, I used AI to provide me concrete examples of coding examples. I have my own personal archive of examples, and often learn fronm these examples to mimic its functionality and proper coding style. For example, during our exploration with React framework, I would often ask for a coding example of how useEffect is properly used, and the many practical examples that comes with it. I store these in my own coding notebooks, and look them up in case I encounter a similiar feature I want to implement.

  10. Explaining code

  Indeed, I have used AI for explaining code. In fact, I would often prompt Co-Pilot to help explain my code, as a way to explain how it works step by step for my own sanity check. This helps me create a positive feedback loop of creating and explaining code more productively. For instance, during the final project, when receiving an error, I would give ChatGPT my own code, and the given error message, and prompted to help me explain what the code is actually doing that resulted in the error message. This helps me save alot of debugging time, and gave me better solutions than what StackOverflow would provide.

  11. Writing code

  Indeed, I have used AI to for writing code. One of my core strategy is using AI to generate a coding template for me to work with. Most of the times, most of the code I was writing were a bit redundant, and I have sought ChatGPT to simply generate a working template for me. For instance, I would ask ChatGPT to generate a React Component template that already has features that I would want, such as a Timer. I would give it the bare minimum to purely generate the functionality, to which I intervene and adjust accordingly.

  12. Documenting code

  Indeed, I have used AI for documenting code. In fact, I would often prompt Co-Pilot to comment my code, as a way to explain how it works step by step. What's interesting with having an AI system embedded in a text editor, when prompted correctly, would auto comment the code, providing a summary or description of the given selected code block. For instance, throughout our learning with Underscore, I would ask Co-Pilot to give me a brief description of this one-liner code, and outputs a reasonable response that allows other programmers to understand.


  13. Quality assurance

  No, unfortuantely I did not, as I was very inactive in the aspects of Quality Assurance in any of my ICS 314 assignments.

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above

  No other AI usages was used besides software engineering and learning tasks.


### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:

The incorporation of AI has immesely influenced my learning experience, in a postitive way. However, it all depends of how we interact with these AI Systems when it comes to how we learn and grow our knowledge. I think its obvious that blindly following AI, specifically for software engineering, would leads to software systems that may function, but upon inspection, you'll be dealing with a system that you don't even understand! So it begs the question - who really is the creator ? You've relied on AI to the point that you don't understand whats happening in the system! Reflecting on these experiences, it's clear that AI technologies have both enhanced and challenged my understanding of software engineering concepts. The key to leveraging AI effectively in learning is to use it as a supplement rather than a substitute for any learning endeavours. I like to analgoize this as a mere human-machine collaboration, than just the machine. Its purpose is to ultimately help you grow, and in this context, help you grow with more knowledge! One key analogy is AI being a training-wheels for whatever we want to be experts in.


### IV. Practical Applications:

Indeed, I was used AI outside of ICS 314, and in fact, I use AI vigourously for my personal coding projects. In fact, I was an early adopter of ChatGPT, initially using it to help me write poems, I now use it to help me create video games, a passion of mine since I learned to understand a computer 'is.' when I was young. In fact, I use AI to help me learn software engineering theories and apply them into my own video game projects, creating a positive feedback loop of theory and practice. Besides purely software knowledge, I used AI to help me conduct research, albeit cross-referencing for truth and sanity check. It became me more productive and makes the engineering process more exciting!


### V. Challenges and Opportunities:

I particular challenge that AI can bring is that it tends to be a 'yes-man', in such sense, that, it completely agrees and comply what you say as truth, and if persisted, you may be influenced with wrong and biased assumptions! This can be problematic, especially in an educational context, where critical thinking and exposure to a variety of perspectives are crucial for growth. Inversely, AI can offer many opportunities, especially in software engineering education. One particular idea is generating a simulation of how it feels working in the software industry! AI-driven simulations that mimic the dynamics of a multi-stakeholder project, including budgeting, ethical considerations, and project management, teamwork dynamics, and gamifying this process would create an immersive and practical learning experience for computer sciences and software engineering.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:

Provide a comparative analysis between traditional teaching methods and AI-enhanced approaches in the context of software engineering education. Consider aspects like engagement, knowledge retention, and practical skill development.

One key difference between traditional teaching and AI-enhanced teaching is the usability between them. What I really love about AI-based technologies, is that they're mostly active 24/7. They respond to you anytime and anywhere without question, and you're freely to ask without being critiqued or judge of what you say. AI-enhanced provides substantial opportunities for accessbility. In terms of knowledge retention, AI-based technologies, if prompt correctly, gives you a personalized learning experience than what a traditional teaching could offer. For instance, I would often let ChatGPT to give me more questions than solutions, in such that I can engange critically akin to socratic dialogues. Though, I do admire some aspects of traditional teaching method, such as physical engangement with the material, and not be bounded by screen and keyboard.

### VII. Future Considerations:

I truly believe AI usage in education can allow ideas such as in-depth personalize educational experience. In fact, I remember dreaming of such application in high school, way before ChatGPT existed. I'd imagine a personal AI bot that could adapt and work with you, learning your style and pacing, and most importantly, focusing on your mental health well-being. This level of dynamics can optimize learning efficiency and keep students more engaged, if not, passionate of what their enganging. Though, as AI tools become more integral to education, there comes with ethics. As of this state, there exist biases in AI algorithms, and further research must be done to ensure that these AI systems promote fairness in all domains, especially in education.

### VIII. Conclusion:

Reflecting on my experiences with AI in ICS314, it is evident that AI has not only revolutionized the way I engage with educational materials but has also improved my ability to innovate and solve problems more effectively. My own integration of AI tools such as ChatGPT and Co-pilot has allowed me to explore software engineering concepts at a depth and pace that would have been challenging through traditional methods alone. AI offered me 24/7 accessibility, instant feedback, and a customizable learning preference that allowed me to dynamically engange with the learning material, fostering a deeper connection of the material. However, this reliance on AI also comes with its challenges. There has been moments, where I was felt like I was heavily dependent on AI, relying too heavily on these technologie, such that it led me to superficial understanding of underlying principles. This directly leads to a scenario where I am more of an operator of AI tools, rather than a creator who fully understands and controls the software I help develop. One thing I want to disperse with my own experiences of AI, is to emphasize the human-machine collaboration aspects of AI. I believe in a symbiosis between the natural and the artificial, human and machine, where we can harness the efficiency and analytical capabilities of AI while also applying the unique creative and critical thinking skills of what defines us - humans.
