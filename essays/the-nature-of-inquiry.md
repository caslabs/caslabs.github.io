The nature of inquiry is quite a fascinating pursuit. We, by definition, are animals that attend to exploit and seek information regarding about everything and anything within the bounds of our senses. We seek truth about everything. Such process involves the manipulation and analysis of information received from the environment. How did the first invention of fire begin to atone? How did the first scientist purposed the idea of gravity? How How did the first philosopher contemplate the nature of existence? Alas,

How did the first software engineer, after creating a bug, decide to call it a 'feature' and not just an 'unplanned feature of surprise'?

Fascinating as these inquiries entails, such reach is bounded by the nature of the inquiry itself. That is, our inquiries we purpose often entails fundamental characteristics and methodologies used in seeking such information in any domain or phenomenon in our lives. Such questions often entails quality information that directly lead to such invention. Often times, high-quality questions results to high-quality solutions.

### The Methodological Approach for Software Engineers

Akin to how scientific inquiry relies on empirical methods, observations, and experiments, and philosophical inquiry focusing more on logical reasoning and conceptual analysis. Us, software engineers, have our own rigorous methodology to crafting our nature of inquiries. One that is grounded by the principles by ESR, or, should I say, the one and only, Eric Steven Raymond, a prominent programmer during the early days of CS, known for his literature work in software engineering and open source, The Cathedral and the Bazaar. He's quite known within the CS lore, and an exemplar that all aspiring software engineers should look up too. Throughout his experiences in software and collaboration, he purposes a series of premises of the nature of software engineering inquiries, or should he say, how "hackers" should strive for when purposing a technical question. It is the social eqittique for software engineers. ESR has full in-depth principles in his blog. For a full analysis, see [How to Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).
Here, I attempt to compress key principles and properties directly into formulating an influential "smart" question:.

1. **Meaningful, Specific Subject Headers:** Design descriptive and technical subject lines for clear engagement. You are enganging with community of domain-expertise and technical audiences, not a general audiences. Try be specific and direct as possible.


2. **Clear, Grammatical Language:** Write questions in well-structured, correct grammar. Hacker-lingo is appropiate, but be professional when converying a question to your best abilities.


3. **Accessible, Standard Formats:** Accessible, Standard Formats: Use standard, widely accessible formats for your queries. Try to strive for direct code blocks and not screenshots of your image. Try not to induce more artificial complexity for your reader.


4. **Be Precise and Informative:** Clearly and accurately describe your problem. ERB goes in depth to such design, but all questions and your attempts to solve such problem should be very detailed and descriptive.


5. **Volume is Not Precision:**  Be concise and focused rather than overly verbose. Don't send ~500 lines of code to your questions, only focus on the root cause of such code file. Which piece of code is causing such error?


6. **Don't Rush to Claim a Bug:** Avoid prematurely diagnosing issues as bugs. In any case, always assume that you are at fault, and not the system itself. Questions should be provoked after a thorough research.


7. **Avoid Grovelling:**  Be objective as possible. Merely state the facts in hand, and avoid presenting yourself as overly humble or self-deprecating. Focus on the task in hand.


8. **Describe Symptoms, Not Guesses:** Focus on what's happening, not on your interpretations. State the errors and factual information as observed. The interpretation happens with the community.


9. **Chronological Symptoms Description:** Present the issue in the order it occurred. Document the entire process, and go step by step to the point of error.


10. **Describe the Goal:** State your ultimate objective, not just the immediate step. Purpose a vision of how this particular problem fits into the bigger picture of the system you're creating.


11. **Be Explicit in Your Question:** Clarify exactly what you're asking. Avoid open-ended responses. Try to provoke leading questions that minimizes time commiment to readers.


12. **When Asking About Code:** Provide context and clarity when asking about code. Strive for a minimal bug-demostrating test case, that is, isolate the rest of your codebase, and provide the very code block that causes such error


13. **Don't Post Homework Questions:** Very straightforward. If the nature of such inquiry is directly tied to Academia (i.e, homeworks, exams, etc.), Seek hints, not solutions.


14. **Prune Pointless Queries:** Avoid unnecessary additions to your question (e.g, "Can anyone help me?") in the end of the question. State the problem via the principles outlined here and pray you'll get a response!


15. **Avoid "Urgent" Tags:**Donâ€™t pressure the readers with urgency. Never formulate a question as a time-sensitive question.


16. **Courtesy Helps:**  Politeness can improve response quality. When in doubt, always end with a "Thank you for your time", to respect the time and effort the community is providing you with.


17. **Follow-Up on Solutions:** Share your solution and thanks to those who helped! Help contribute to the never-ending open source community ecosystem, and those who will encounter a smiliar situation as yours in the future.

Again, for a full detailed analysis and explantation per principles as outlined by ERB, see ERB's blog - [How to Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html). There's other principles ERB goes over beyond just the formulation of the inquiry, such as choosing the right community and various examples of "smart" and "not smart" questions, which is equally important for formulating a smart question as well.

### Concrete Examples

With our illustration of the key principles of outlined by ERB above, we will examine concrete examples, or real case studies, that are found within StackOverFlow, a promiment open source community which in which thousands of programmers and engineers-alike come to purpose and provide solutions to the never ending open source software ecosystem:

### Evaluation

We, software engineers, have our own rigorous methodology to crafting our nature of inquiries. We tend to craft our inquiries to maximize producitive output, akin to how scientist utilize their own methodology to produce productive results, or how and historians methodically analyze past events to understand and interpret our world, we too approach our software engineering problems with a structured and analytical mindset. By adopting established guidelines like those set forth by Eric S. Raymond, we maximize our productive output and contribute to the advancement of our field, being more pragmatic to our day to day activities.
