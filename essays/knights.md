### Chivary And Coding

Just as knights were expected to uphold honor and duty, coding standards emphasize readability, maintainability, and functionality in code. With that, programmers adhere to standards written by the architecture, to whom that whoever be. I beleive coding standards does teach you how the certain naunces of a programming languages. But I believe, moreso, that creating the coding standards is more appropriate for learning a programming language. My key reason is that this particular activity requires understanding the sets of bad practices in programming languages, and mitigations of such behaviors by designing your own conventions, and teaching these to your team.

I suppose in code review acitivities, you have your own conventions beyond the adhered coding standards set by the documentation, that makes you a strong programmer.


### Quest for the Holy Code

Through my experiences, ESLint has always been a pain to integrate for the first time in any coding project. But I understand, now, that this particular phase of software engineering is the most crucial, as it involves creating quality code that will be read by thousands of people, and shipped to millions of people. Adhering to the standards are not just to enforce quality, but enforcing a system that maintainable years down the line.
