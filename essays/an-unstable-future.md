The Lorenz equations are deterministic, given intiial conditions and parameters, it is, in theory, allow us to predict the future behavior of the system. Deterministic as it is, these simple rules and equations often creates the emergence of complexity, and such system is impossible to predict due to the extreme sensestivity to the initial conditions. Hence, emergence.

First and foremost, I was dead certain about entering the tech industry ever since I was in middle school. Though, originally, I envision myself as working in an atypical office from an atypical company, and my first vision was being some sort of office worker working on a calculator software making around $70k yearly. Boring as it sounds, that is what I've been taught what programming was when I first started. Now, it's one of the most chaotic and money-making industry in the world, wide ranging from artificial intelligence, video games, and web applications. Throughout my high school, I was, obsess about entering big tech, as my dreams of working in Google and Facebook would solidify of being amongst my people that I relate to the most. Nowadays, I'm quite confused of what I want to do with comptuer sciences. Realistically speaking, I was trained as a software engineer through various internships through various startups during my university, and to be quite honest, I don't find such work ammusing as I thought would be. Indeed, such previous experiences would naturally align myself to work somewhere in big tech as a new grad. It's been a making since my high school days, so might as well achieve such goals as a promise to my young self.

Now, which industry satifies suits me? I'm am quite uncertain in this aspects of my intial professional career. I've been thinking about such domains to pursue, and even the domains of that domain. For example, do i see a path in video games? If so, which type of video game work that satisifies me the most? Game Engine Development like implementing a resource management system and game loop or Game Programming like implementing game mechanics and game systems. Or say, Artficial Intelligence and its many fields like computer vision or natural language processing. I could generalize this and pursue Data Sciences and do analytics and analysis of business data. All of these domains I've been fortunately exposed through various internships during my univeristy. Now, which one to go for, I'm not quite sure where to go. But I suppose, that, throughout the years of doing industry and job hopping from one work culture to another, I hope to find which domain is the best for me. Particulally, one of the criteria I'm looking for in a tech job is that I can fully zone in and be within the flow long periods of time. The thought of 'work' is often less encountered, and the thought of 'play' fuels my mind. Even with this very simple goal in mind, complexitiy often emerges from a single point of event. In this case, every event throughout my initial CS career is pivotal to what my future would be down the line.

I suppose another passion that is currently brewing is within Academia. Now, I'm quite burnout in this field, and quite frankly, I do not see myself pursuing a grad in the near future, or right after undergraduate. However, research has piqued my interests lately, and I can myself doing research in AI. My key reason is that I see myself working as an AI research scientist in my later life, and out of all fields that I've dabbled, AI seems to be engross my focus and attention for a long periods of time. The study and pursue of the human cognition, and how to build is a really fascinating problem that I could write and research for years nonstop. With that said, I believe that my future plans are quite unstabled just like the Lorenz equation. Though, I am dead certain of the initial conditions, it often leads to a chaotic system, one that is unpredicatable yet deterministic. But i suppose, with the current market, having just a tech job is key achievement itself, and while not necessarily a passion activity, it is what most people would take considering the influx amount of layoffs happening in the late 2023s and ongoing to 2024.
