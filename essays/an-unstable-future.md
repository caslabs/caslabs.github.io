First and foremost, I was dead certain about entering the tech industry ever since I was in middle school. Though, originally, I envision myself as working in a atypical office from an atypical company, and my first vision was an office worker working on a calculator software making around $70k yearly. Boring as it sounds, that is what I've been taught what programming was when I first started. Now, it's one of the most chaotic and money-making industry in the world, wide ranging from artificial intelligence, video games, and web applications. Throughout my high school life, I was, now dead certain about entering big tech, as my dreams of working in Google and Facebook would solidify of being amongst my people that I relate to the most. Nowadays, I'm quite confused of what I want to do with comptuer sciences. Realistically speaking, I was trained as a software engineer through various internships through various startups during my university, and to be quite frank, I don't find such work ammusing as I thought would be. So, such previous experiences would natural align myself to work somewhere in Big Tech as a new grad. It's been a making since my high school days, so might as well achieve such goals as a promise to my young self.

Now, which industry satifies the most? I've been thinking about such domains to pursue, and even the domain of that domain. For example, do i see a path in video games? If so, which type of video game work that satisifies me the most? Game Engine Development or Game Programming like implementing game mechanics and systems. Or say, Artficial Intelligence. and its many fields like computer vision or natural language processing, or I could go general and pursue Data Sciences and do analytics and analysis of business data. For this particular future, I'm not quite sure where to go. But I suppose, that, throughout the years of doing industry and hopping jobs, I hope to find which domain is the best for me. Particulally, one of the criteria I'm looking for is a tech job that I can fully zone in and be within the flow for 8 hours everday. The thought of 'work' is often less encountered, and the thought of 'play' is what I want to encounter everday.

Another passion that I'm interested in is also Academia. Now, I'm quite burnout in this field, and quite frankly, I do not see myself pursuing a grad in the near future, or right after undergraduate. However, research has pique my interests lately, and I would like to do research in AI. My key reason is that I see myself working as an AI research scientist in my later life, and out of all fields that I've dabbled, AI seems to be engross my focus and attention for a long periods of time. The study and pursue of the human cognition, and how to build is a really fascinating problem that I could write and research for years nonstop. With that said, I beleive that my future plans are quite unstabled. Though, I am dead certain of working in tech, what kind of tech is not necessarily fleshed out. But i suppose, with the current market, having just a tech job and not necessarily a passion job, is what most people would take.
