The Lorenz equations are deterministic, given initial conditions and parameters, it is, in theory, allow us to predict the future behavior of the system. Deterministic as it is, these simple rules and equations often creates the emergence of complexity, and such system is impossible to predict due to the extreme sensestivity to the initial conditions. Hence, emergence.

First and foremost, I was dead certain about entering the tech industry ever since I was in middle school. Though, originally, I envision myself as working in an atypical office from an atypical company, and my first vision was being some sort of office worker working on a calculator software making around $70k yearly. Boring as it sounds, that is what I've been taught what programming was when I first started. Now, it's one of the most chaotic and money-making industry in the world, wide ranging from artificial intelligence, video games, and web applications. Throughout my high school, I was, obsess about entering big tech, as my dreams of working in Google and Facebook would solidify of being amongst my people that I relate to the most. I didn't care about the money or the prestige of the company, I just wanted **friends** that understood me.

Nowadays, I'm quite confused of what I want to do with computer sciences. I was trained as a software engineer through various internships and various startups I've made during my university, and to be quite honest, I don't find such work ammusing as I thought would be. Indeed, such previous experiences would naturally align myself to work somewhere in big tech as a new grad. It's been a making since my middle school days, so might as well achieve such goals as a promise to my young self.

Now, which industry satifies suits me? I'm quite uncertain in this aspects of my intial professional career. I've been thinking about such domains to pursue, and even the domains of that domain. For example, do i see a path in video games? If so, which type of video game work that satisifies me the most? Game Engine Development like implementing a resource management system and game loop or Game Programming like implementing game mechanics and game systems. Funny as this sound, such decision could factor what I'll be in the next five to ten years from now!

Or say, Artficial Intelligence and its many fields like computer vision or natural language processing. I could generalize this and pursue Data Sciences and do analytics and analysis of business data. I could completely writing web application code and simply navigate and analyze datasets.

I was fortunate enough to take the opportunity during my University to gain all these domain experiences, either randomly or making that opportunity exist for myself. I've been exposed through various internships during my univerist that showed me the reality of working in tech. Now, which one to go for, I'm not quite sure where to go. But I suppose, that, throughout my future years of doing industry and job hopping from one work culture to another, I simply hope to find which domain is the best for me. Particulally, a criteria that I'm looking for in a tech job is that I can fully zone in and be within the flow long periods of time. The thought of 'work' is often less encountered, and the thought of 'play' would fuel my mind.

I suppose another passion that is currently brewing is within Academia. Now, I'm quite burnout with school, and quite frankly, I do not see myself pursuing a grad in the near future, or right after undergraduate. However, research has piqued my interests lately, and I can myself doing research in AI. My key reason is that I see myself working as an AI research scientist in my later life, and out of all fields that I've dabbled, AI seems to be engross my focus and attention for a long periods of time. The study and the pursuit of human cognition, and how to build one is a really fascinating problem that I could write and research for years nonstop. With that said, I believe that my future plans are quite unstabled just like the Lorenz equation. Though, I am dead certain of the initial conditions, that is, working in tech, such system is also a chaotic system, one that is unpredicatable due to the slighest adjustment of the initial conditions. I could venture far into video games and set a path writing games for a large sum of my life, or take an offer in machine learning and help engineer the AI-based future until the first super-intelligent machine comes to take my job. I could completely drop all of that, and just start my own startup and do my own thing. An unstable future, indeed.


But i suppose, with the current market, having just a tech job is quite an achievement itself, and while it may not necessarily be the job you wanted, it is what most people would take considering the influx amount of layoffs happening in the late 2023s and ongoing to 2024. Such are strange times in tech.
