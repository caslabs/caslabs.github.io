My fellow founders and I co-founded a NLP (Natural Language Processing) AI healthcare accessibility startup that connects patients with their healthcare providers in a simple intuitive manner that gained traction of over 1000+ unique visitors in a two-day time frame. We've orchested the concept and executed with a robust full stack application that allows users to communicate with their health care providers via a seemingless SMS and Web App pipeline. We've sstablished LEAN principles, rapidly launched a B2B SaaS product tailored for local healthcare providers, and participated in a pitch deck to 100+ people and healthcare companies. cairtext.com, built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Firebase Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us), and deployed to [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).

I served as the technical co-founder of our startup (thats me on the far left) of our founders photo, where I was the lead engineer that orchestrated the live web services for this startup. I was responsible of leading my other fellow technical co-founder to build and launch cairtext.com into the interwebs, and injecting data analytics and signs ups for potential users of our targeted market. With my technical knowledge, we've gotten over thousands of visitors into our site, and as well as a few dozens of sign ups of our startup idea.

For our minimum viable product, I've designed and implemented our semi-automated two way messaging system for healthcare providers and envision its implementation with AI in the communication pipeline, to provide productive tooling services for healthcare providers.

As we believed a messaging platform that can be trustworthy, intuitive, confidential, and easily customizable to meet the specific needs of your practice.

During this experience, I learned the naunces of being within the tech startup ecosystem. It is the result of naturally having a problem within your field of work, and designign a solution to such problem, and figuring out a business model of that solution. As a technical co-founder, I've often have to translate our software system to the general audiences, allowing the understandment of our vision. I learned how to accumlate a mass of users, and market software correctly.
