For our AI4ALL cohort program, my colleagues and mentor orchestrated a Music Transformer AI system, aimed at generating music using deep learning techniques. The generative AI project is built upon a transformer-based architecture for musical generation and is trained on the Maestro v3 dataset. We have also programmed a series of supplementary Jupyter notebooks to provide an in-depth understanding of our thought process and methodology to how we can generate music using natural language processing methodologies. We've implemented the Transformer-XL architecture that treated music generation as a language problem, where we perceive musical notes as a natural language, to which we can predict the next sequence of words to generate a musical piece.

I was the lead programmer that orchestrated the music generating AI. Along with my mentor and colleagues, we discussed in-depth of the machine learning workflow, from data sourcing to data exploration, and feature engineering and engineering our model. We designed a model that handles MIDI data and generate new music based on patterns from the Maestro V3 dataset, an open source dataset that includes various composers and their musical pieces. I also orchestrated the data visualization and analysis component of our project, to which we presented our findings to our cohort community and AI industry folks.

Throughout this process, I learned about generative AI, and its pros and cons currently as 2023-2024. I learned more about collaborating with a team, and also asking the right questions to our mentor, who had experience in industry AI, hailing as a senior machine learning engineer. Since this was our first generative AI project, I've learned more about deep laerning architectures and what powers modern GPT systems, and how expensive such experiments are often conducted.
